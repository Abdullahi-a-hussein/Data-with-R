# Data-with-R
This repo contains some data analytic reports. These reports are generated using Rstudio. Some of these projects include:

- <a href="https://github.com/Abdullahi-a-hussein/Data-with-R/blob/main/ARIMA-models.pdf">ARIMA models diagnostics, ARIMA model forecasting, and Spectral Analysis for Time Series data</a>.

  This file includes:
  - Model Selection
  - Model fitting
  - Model diagnostics
  - Prediction Using the selected Model
  - Spectre Analysis to determine the strongest frequencies.

- <a href="https://github.com/Abdullahi-a-hussein/Data-with-R/blob/main/Regression.md"> Regression Analysis with Continuous variables </a>

  The data used in this file comes from **Faraway** library, fat data. We are trying to predict fat percentage, _siri_ using the rest of the predictors excluding _brozek_ and _density_. This is what is included in this file:
    - Fitting Linear regression with all of the predictors
    - Linear regression that selects variable using AIC
    - Partial Component variable selection Regression
    - Partial Least Square Variable selection Regression
    - Ridge Regression
    - Lasso Regression
    - Comparing The performace of the above models using Residual Mean Square Error (RMSE) method and deciding which model does the best.
